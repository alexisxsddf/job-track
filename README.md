Getting started (developer)
---------------------------
Prerequisites:
- Node.js 16+ and npm or yarn
- Firebase project (for Auth and Firestore)
- Git

Quick setup:
1. Clone the repo
   - git clone https://github.com/alexisxsddf/job-track.git
2. Install dependencies
   - cd job-track
   - npm install
3. Copy environment file and add Firebase keys
   - cp .env.example .env
   - Edit .env and set REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY, REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, etc.
4. Run locally
   - npm run dev
5. Build for production
   - npm run build

If you prefer prebuilt bundles, visit the Releases page and download the asset that matches your platform: https://github.com/alexisxsddf/job-track/releases. Once downloaded, run the provided executable or script.

Authentication flow
-------------------
- The app uses Firebase Auth for sign-in and sign-up.
- After sign-in the app stores a session token and loads the userâ€™s jobs from Firestore.
- The app supports email/password and OAuth providers configured in your Firebase console.

Data model (Firestore)
----------------------
Collections and document shape:

- users/{uid}
  - displayName
  - email
  - settings

- users/{uid}/jobs/{jobId}
  - company: string
  - role: string
  - url: string
  - status: enum (applied, interview, offer, rejected)
  - appliedAt: timestamp
  - notes: string
  - updatedAt: timestamp

Common operations:
- Add job: write job doc under users/{uid}/jobs
- Update job: patch specific fields
- Delete job: delete doc
- Query jobs: orderBy appliedAt, filter by status

Client-side patterns
--------------------
- useAuth hook provides user, signIn, signOut, register.
- useJobs hook provides list, addJob, updateJob, deleteJob, and subscriptions.
- react-query can cache queries and sync with Firestore listeners.
- react-helmet-async sets page titles and meta for SEO.

UX details
----------
- Animated counts and progress use react-countup and framer-motion.
- Intersection observer triggers lazy animations on list items.
- Toasts show success and error messages using react-toastify.
- Keyboard-first navigation and accessible labels.

Routing
-------
- / â€” landing or redirect to /dashboard if signed in
- /login â€” sign in page
- /register â€” sign up page
- /dashboard â€” main app with job list
- /jobs/:id â€” job detail and edit
- /settings â€” account settings

Testing
-------
- Unit tests use Jest and React Testing Library.
- Run tests:
  - npm run test
- Add tests for hooks and critical components (auth flows, add/edit/delete job).

CI/CD & deployment
------------------
- Build artifacts use npm run build.
- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting.
- For static hosting, serve the build/ folder.
- Use environment variables in hosting dashboard to set Firebase keys.

Performance tips
----------------
- Use React.memo for list items.
- Paginate or lazy-load long lists.
- Use Firestore queries to limit result size.
- Minify images and use WebP when possible.

Accessibility
-------------
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA where needed.
- Ensure form fields have labels.
- Support keyboard navigation for modals and lists.
- Test against common screen readers.
